## General Guidelines

Some quick notes when making a pull request.

- Match the style and formatting of the code you are editing.
- Each pull request should be focused on a single thing (a single bug fix, a single feature, etc.). This makes reviewing easier and minimizes merge conflicts.
- Include a description of the problem being solved and what your code does. Steps to reproduce the problem or example input/output are very helpful.
