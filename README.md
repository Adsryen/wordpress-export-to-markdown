# wordpress-export-to-markdown

Converts a WordPress export XML file into Markdown files. This makes it easy to migrate from WordPress to a static site generator ([Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), etc.).

## Features

- Saves each post as a separate Markdown file with frontmatter.
- Also saves drafts, pages, and custom post types, if you have any.
- Downloads images and updates references to them.
- User-friendly wizard guides you through the process.
- Lots of command line options for configuration, if needed.

## Quick Start

You'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- Your [WordPress export file](https://wordpress.org/support/article/tools-export-screen/). Be sure to export "All Content".

Then run this in your terminal:

```
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown
```

## Options

The script will start with a wizard to ask you a few questions.

Optionally, you can provide answers to any of these questions via command line arguments, in which case the wizard will skip asking those questions. Here's an example:

```
npx wordpress-export-to-markdown --post-folders=false --prefix-date=true
```

The questions, and their command line arguments, are given below.

### Path to WordPress export file? (`--input`)

The path to your [WordPress export file](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-export-screen/). Default is `export.xml`.

To make things easier, you can rename your WordPress export file to `export.xml` and drop it into the same directory that you run the script from.

### Put each post into its own folder? (`--post-folders`)

Whether or not to create a separate folder for each post's Markdown file (and images). Default is `true`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | A folder is created for each post, with an `index.md` file and `/images` folder within. The post slug is used to name the folder. |
| `false` | The post slug is used to name each post's Markdown file. These files are all saved in the same folder. All images are saved in a shared `/images` folder. |

### Add date prefix to posts? (`--prefix-date`)

Whether or not to prepend the post date when naming a post's folder or file. Default is `false`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Prepend the date, in the format `<year>-<month>-<day>`. Nothing will be prepended if there is no date (for example, an undated draft post). |
| `false` | Don't prepend the date. |

### Organize posts into date folders? (`--date-folders`)

If and how output is organized into folders based on date. Default is `none`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `year` | Output is organized into folders by year. This won't happen for posts with no date (for example, an undated draft post). |
| `yearâ€‘month` | Output is organized into folders by year, then into nested folders by month. Again, for posts with no date, this won't happen. |
| `none` | No date folders are created. |

### Save images? (`--save-images`)

Which images you want to download and save. Default is `all`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attached` | Save images attached to posts. Generally speaking, these are images that were uploaded by using **Add Media** or **Set Featured Image** in WordPress. |
| `scraped` | Save images scraped from `<img>` tags in post body content. The `<img>` tags are updated to point to where the images are saved. |
| `all` | Save all images, essentially the results of `attached` and `scraped` combined. |
| `none` | Don't save any images. |

## Advanced Options

These are not included in the wizard, so you'll need to set them on the command line.

### Path to output folder? (`--output`)

The path to the output folder where files will be saved. It'll be created if it doesn't exist. Default is `output`.

Existing files in the output folder won't be overwritten. Furthermore, existing images won't be downloaded again. This lets you resume progress by restarting the script, if it was previously terminated early. To start clean, delete the output folder.

### Frontmatter fields? (`--frontmatter-fields`)

Comma separated list of the frontmatter fields to include in Markdown files. Order is preserved. If a post doesn't have a value for a field, it is left off. Default is `title,date,categories,tags,coverImage,draft`.

Available fields are: `author`, `categories`, `coverImage`, `date`, `draft`, `excerpt`, `id`, `slug`, `tags`, `title`, `type`. You can rename a field by appending `:` followed by the alias to use. For example, `date:created` will rename `date` to `created`.

### Delay between image file requests? (`--request-delay`)

Time (in milliseconds) to wait between requesting image files. Default is `500`.

Increasing this might help if you see timeouts or server errors.

### Delay between writing markdown files? (`--write-delay`)

Time (in milliseconds) to wait between saving Markdown files. Default is `10`.

Increasing this might help if your file system becomes overloaded.

### Timezone to apply to date? (`--timezone`)

The timezone applied to post dates, as [specified here](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/zones?id=specifying-a-zone). Default is `utc`.

### Include time with frontmatter date? (`--include-time`)

Whether or not time should be included with the date in frontmatter. Default is `false`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Time is included using an ISO 8601-compliant format. For example, `2020-12-25T11:20:35.000Z`. |
| `false` | Time is not included. For example, `2020-12-25`. |

### Frontmatter date format string? (`--date-format`)

A custom formatting string to apply to frontmatter dates, using [these tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens). If set, takes precedence over `--include-time`. Default is an empty string, which falls back to the basic `<year>-<month>-<day>` format.

### Wrap frontmatter date in quotes? (`--quote-date`)

Whether or not to put double quotes around the date when writing it to frontmatter. Default is `false`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Adds double quotes around the date. This technically turns the date into a string value. |
| `false` | Doesn't add double quotes. |

### Use strict SSL? (`--strict-ssl`)

Whether or not to use strict SSL when downloading images. Default is `true`.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `true` | Use strict SSL. This is the safer option. |
| `false` | Don't use strict SSL. This will let you avoid the "self-signed certificate" error when working with a self-signed server. Just make sure you know what you're doing. |
